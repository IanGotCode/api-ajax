Please create a github repository with a README that explains how to approach and implement connecting javascript applications to an API using AJAX. You do not have to write any code, but may use pseudo code and code examples in your README to explain the process. There is not a strict word or page limit, but it should be appropriate length to convey your ideas.


For starts, AJAX is used to access the api. Via AJAX you will use methods, Restful Routing (GET(Show, Index), POST(Create), PATCH/PUT(Update) & DELETE(Delete). You are able to create your backend using AJAX, which stores information that a user can input when everything is connected to the api and is presented on a web pages user interface. When a user signs up that would be using the create (POST)routes, which if working correctly will allow the user to create an account with email and password and will be stored in the database. After creating an account, the user is now able to log in with the account just created. When logging in you are also using the (POST) route. If log in is successful, you will have the opportunity to change your password, or even sign out. When changing password, you will use your old password, then use a new password. When doing this, the route that is being used is (PATCH) if successful. When signing out, the route that is being used is simply (DELETE).
